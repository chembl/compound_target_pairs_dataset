# Introduction
This code extract a dataset of compound-target pairs from the open-source bioactivity database [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) [Zdrazil2023]. 

The compound-target pairs are known to interact because 

- they have at least one corresponding measured activitiy values in ChEMBL or 
- they are part of a set of manually curated known interactions in ChEMBL.

Furthermore, the dataset contains a number of compound and target annotations to enable future analyses. 

Previously, a similar dataset has been curated manually and has been used to investigate target-based differences in drug-like properties and ligand efficiencies [Leeson2021]. 
This code can generate an extended version of the previous dataset for every ChEMBL version from ChEMBL 26 onwards.

# Quick Start
## Dependencies
Install the required dependencies with
```
pip install .
```

Note: Using pandas version 2.2 will lead to warnings regarding the RDKit PandasTools when running the code. 
However, the final dataset is not impacted. 


## Generating the Dataset
The default version of the dataset (the full dataset as a CSV file based on the newest ChEMBL version) can be generated by calling 
```
python main.py -o <output_path>
```

An overview of the available arguments to modify the output is available by calling 

```
python main.py --help
```
