Column Name,Type,Cpd or Target info?,Description / Notes
in_dm_table,Bool,Compound-Target Pair,Is the compound-target pair (taking mutation annotation into account) in the drug mechanism table?
keep_for_binding,Bool,Compound-Target Pair,"Rows to keep if interested in information based only on binding assays + the drug_mechanism table. True if pchembl_value_mean_B (based on binding assays) exists or if in_dm_table == True, i.e., the pair is in the drug mechanism table."
