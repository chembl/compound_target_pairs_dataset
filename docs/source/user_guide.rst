User Guide
==========
The default version of the dataset (the full dataset as a CSV file) can be generated by calling 

::

    python main.py -o <path_to_outputfile>

with further options explained in `Arguments`_.

An overview of the available arguments is also available by calling 

::

    python main.py --help

The output will always contain the full dataset as a CSV file. 
The arguments only allow for the output of additional files or modify how the full dataset is extracted.  



Arguments
*********
.. csv-table:: 
   :file: tables/userguide.csv
   :widths: 20, 10, 10, 10, 50
   :header-rows: 1



Accessing ChEMBL
****************
ChEMBL is accessed either through a given path to an SQLite database download or through the `chembl_downloader package`_. 
In both cases, SQLite is used to query ChEMBL. 
ChEMBL 21 is the earliest version for which there is an SQLite database release 
and it is therefore the earliest for which the dataset can currently be calculcated.

.. _chembl_downloader package: https://github.com/cthoyt/chembl-downloader
